Sample implementation of samedi.de Appointment booking API
==========================================================

This is a quick demonstration of how to book an appointment with samedi.de's
appointment booking API using OAuth2.

This code is by no means complete and not really tested but it took us only 2 hours to write. Feel free to use it as a basis for your own implementation.
